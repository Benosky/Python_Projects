Assignment: Branch and Bound
Problem 1:  Cutting plane method  

Solve the following problem using cutting plane method:

min f = 4x1 + 5x2
    x1 + 4x2 >=5
    3x1 + 2x2 >=7
    x1,x2>=0, both integer

Use Python for the implementation for your Algorithm.  Adhere to the code guidelines mentioned below.
